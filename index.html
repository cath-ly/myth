    <h1>Common Misconception</h1>
    <h3>ANIME HAS SPARKED THE WORLD AROUND US</h3>
    <p>Anime has motivated many of the young minds and adults of this generation, for anime it can give virtues to the people and spark happiness they lack from the real world. Anime has aided me by seeing perspectives and sending themes that can be adapted to modern society. Whether it is the references of what Japan never sees due to its "normal" society, or even the "taboos" no one talks about in society, the signals and implications there truly spark a generation. Anime not only influences kids but can be targeted to society as a whole with its appeals to different age. Focusing on the classic action genre intended for young teens, or ones that express deeper meanings targeted for adults to take on what challenges the hidden struggles of society that is never talked about. Anime brings conversation to the community within and can truly break that barrier if able to be talked through in seminars since they are worhty of being talked through. For an example, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood(FMAB) can most definitely be a question to adults although being targeted to young teens, questions like "What is Truth?" or "How does this connect to real life situation with genocide, etc.?" FMAB breaks the mold and heavily revolves on its thematic message of truly sacrificing yourself to discover what makes you sense your weakness and overcoming it. Attaining this message eternally makes virtues of people that truly felt compelled with a series like that and develop one's soul and influence others. Inspirations of animation itself can be seen throughout the world we live in today and does not strictly influence the youth, but rather the generation.</p>

    <p>What I was doing was talking about what I wish to communicate without having them bolster their argument, trying to give an example in order to not have them overwhelm with info and push away the data. Start off with the core fact to begin with and the facts with a small amount of myth to replace the gap it contains.</p>
